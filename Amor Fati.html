        <p>"Amor fati," a Latin phrase meaning "love of fate," refers to the philosophical concept of embracing everything that happens in life—both the good and the bad—as necessary and valuable. It encourages a mindset of acceptance and love for one's circumstances, recognizing that each event, whether perceived as positive or negative, contributes to the unfolding of one's existence. Rooted in Stoicism, particularly in the works of Friedrich Nietzsche, amor fati advocates for a life lived in harmony with the flow of events, where one doesn't just endure fate but actively loves and welcomes it.</p>

        <blockquote class="vid-caption">The great German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche would describe his formula for human greatness as amor fati—a love of fate. “That one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backwards, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it….but love it.”

The Stoics were not only familiar with this attitude but they embraced it. Two thousand years ago, writing in his own personal journal which would become known as Meditations, Emperor Marcus Aurelius would say: “A blazing fire makes flame and brightness out of everything that is thrown into it.” Another Stoic, Epictetus, who as a crippled slave has faced adversity after adversity, echoed the same: “Do not seek for things to happen the way you want them to; rather, wish that what happens happen the way it happens: then you will be happy.”</blockquote>
